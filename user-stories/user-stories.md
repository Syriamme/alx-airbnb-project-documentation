# User Stories for Airbnb Clone

## 1. User Registration
**As a guest or host,**  
I would like to have are the ability to sign up for an account using my email address or OAuth such as Google or Facebook.  
In the event that I wish to book a property or list a property on the system, I need to create a profile first.

## 2. Property Search & Filter
**As a guest,**  
I would like to use the search functionality to narrow my selections by area, price, or additional features.  
This is to help me quickly get an accommodation so that I can book it conveniently.

## 3. Property Listing Management
**As a host,**  
This feature will allow me to create new property listings, edit or even remove them from the system.  
For that purpose I need to track those properties which I have allowed for bookings and to make sure that the information is up-to-date.

## 4. Booking a Property
**As a guest,**  
I want to search and book a property of my preference for my preferred period.  
Thus, I can book a room where I will be sleeping during my trip without having other bookings interfering with it.

## 5. Payment Processing
**As a guest,**  
I need to ensure that my payment for the booking can be done through integrated payment gateways that are secure and safe (for example, Stripe, PayPal).  
Thus, that I can feel confident in fulfilling my reservation and that the payment will be processed safely.
