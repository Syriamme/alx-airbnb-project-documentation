# User Stories for Airbnb Clone

## Overview

This document outlines the key **user stories** for the **Airbnb Clone** project. Each user story describes a specific interaction between the system and the user, capturing the **goals** and **value** for the users of the platform. These user stories help guide the design and development of the core features of the application.

## Purpose of User Stories

User stories are an important part of Agile development, helping to ensure that the system is built with a focus on the **end user experience**. They outline what a user needs from the system, why they need it, and how it should function. By framing development from the user's perspective, user stories promote functionality that aligns with real user needs and enhance the overall user experience.

## Key User Stories

### 1. User Registration
- **As a guest or host**, I want to be able to register an account using my email or OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook), so that I can create a profile and use the system to either book properties or list my own.

### 2. Property Search & Filter
- **As a guest**, I want to search for properties based on location, price, and amenities, so that I can easily find a property that meets my needs for booking.

### 3. Property Listing Management
- **As a host**, I want to be able to add, edit, or delete my property listings, so that I can manage the properties I have available for booking and keep my listings up to date.

### 4. Booking a Property
- **As a guest**, I want to be able to book a property for my desired dates, so that I can reserve a place to stay for my trip without conflicting bookings.

### 5. Payment Processing
- **As a guest**, I want to securely pay for my booking through integrated payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), so that I can complete my reservation with confidence, knowing that my payment is securely processed.
