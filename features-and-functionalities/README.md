   - **Create Listings**: Hosts can create new properties where they can enter basic information such as title, description, location, and amenities.
   - **Edit/Delete Listings**: The way that hosts interact with their property is through having full privileges and authority to either keep, edit, or delete a listing.

### 3. **Search & Filtering**
   - **Search Properties**: This way, guests can look for properties by location, price, number of guests, etc.
   - **Filter Options**: Further refinements such as pet-friendly, Wi-Fi, pool, etc.
