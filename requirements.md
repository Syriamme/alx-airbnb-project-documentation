      ```

- **POST /api/logout**
  - **Description**: Causes the session to expire thereby logging out the user from the system.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "token": "string"
    }

  – Token should be returned in case of successful login.

### Performance Criteria:
C- Response time must not exceed **200ms** for successful requests[edge weight=1]
For heavy traffic, API should be able to accommodate **5000 requests** per minute.

      "location": "string",
      "amenities": ["string"]
    }
